    <p> Testing the style sheet, this should be obnoxiously orange</p>

    <p class="address"> This is an address paragraph
        <br>
        <br>some guy
        <br>some street
        <br>a shithole town
        <br>a crappy state
        <br>hell
    </p>


    <!-- leaving the first P in the css will make the P stuff within the division the colour and font but it will still use the address alignment.
gotta somehow work out some way to separate blank P from div P or just a different way to classify them? maybe have the address before the P in the css so that it calls for those details afterwards -->

    <div class="address">
        <br>some guy
        <br>some street
        <br>shithole town
        <br>crappy state
        <br>hell<
    </div>

    <p>This part of the text will call on a <span class="codeInText">style</span> to add style properties to a particular element rather than an entire section</p>

    <p style="color: black;">This part of the text will <span class="rollover">change colour</span> as the mouse hovers over it</p>
